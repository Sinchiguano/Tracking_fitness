#Write a class called ExerciseSession. ExerciseSession

#integer: the strings represent the exercise name and the
#exercise intensity, which will be "Low", "Moderate", or
#"High". The integer will represent the length of the
#exercise session in minutes. These should be saved in the
#instance of the class.
