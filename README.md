# Tracking_fitness
Imagine you're writing an exercise-tracking app like Fitbit
or MyFitnessPal. Part of this exercise is to create a tiny app where the user can log an exercise session by naming the exercise, the intensity, and the duration. Afterwards, depending on the setting parameters, we can retrieve an integer representing the calories burned according to the following formula:
- If the intensity is "Low", 4 calories are burned per minute.
- If the intensity is "Moderate", 8 calories are burned per minute.
- If the intensity is "High", 12 calories are burned per  minute.
